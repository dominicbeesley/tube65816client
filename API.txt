EMUlation mode BRK handler
==========================

As the EMU mode BRK handler doesn't (and cannot) know the bank in which the error occurred
case must be taken when running EMUlation mode code in banks other than 0.

Either:
  - Don't run EMU code in banks other than bank 0
  - Install a BRK handler in bank 0 that knows which bank the current code is running from

BRK Handler Program Bank
========================
The native BRK handler sets an extra bank register at &FC(TBC) to indicate the bank in which 
the error occurred, the emulation mode BRK handler assumes bank 0 and clears this. This can
be used in conjunction with the regular FE/FD pointer to find the BRK instruction


Code run
========
TODO: have method of flagging native code?
All code is entered in EMUlation mode. Code that is to run from banks other than 0 should
either install a suitable BRK handler immediately or switch to native mode.



OSWORD 0 
========

The pointer at 0..1 is 16 bits and so has to be in bank0!


Interrupt Handlers in EMU mode
==============================

- These will probably crash if the databank is not 0 TODO: look at this and come up with test cases

===========

Todo: all entry points and interrupt handlers need to reset/restore DP
